However, critical backend implementations for getAllOrders, getAllRepairOrders, getAllPiercingServices, and getAllOtherServices are missing from the truncated backend/main.mo file. The frontend hooks are present with extensive logging as requested, but without corresponding backend query methods, the data fetching issues cannot be resolved.",
