  "summary": "Footer attribution was removed and replaced with a minimal © {year} line. OrderWizard changes add logic for detecting Material=\"Other\", overriding weight-field enabled flags, clearing Order Type when Material is Other, and auto-zeroing weight fields; however, the diff snippet is truncated before showing the actual input components, so it’s not fully verifiable that the UI inputs in Steps 2 and 3 are disabled/visually muted and that rate/material-cost are handled per requirements.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "When Material is set to \"Other\", disable the Weight step inputs (Exchange Wt, Deduct Wt, Added Wt) and keep Total Wt non-editable; switching back re-enables according to existing order-type rules.",
      "reason": "The diff shows state/logic for overriding enabled flags and zeroing weight fields when Material is \"Other\", but the provided OrderWizard diff is truncated before the Step 2 input JSX, so there is no direct evidence that the actual inputs are rendered with disabled props and muted styling, nor that switching back restores the original order-type-based rules in the UI.",

      "requirement": "When Material is set to \"Other\", disable Rate/gram (ratePerGm) and Material Cost (materialCost) in the Amount step, keep/set them to \"0\", and re-enable when switching back.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet does not show any logic or JSX related to disabling ratePerGm/materialCost or forcing their values to 0 when Material becomes \"Other\". The file summary text mentions it, but there is no concrete evidence in the truncated diff excerpt.",
      "evidence": [
