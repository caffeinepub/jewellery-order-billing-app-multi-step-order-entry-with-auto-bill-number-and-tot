  "summary": "The diff implements stable storage for backend state variables and adds comprehensive frontend error handling. All four requirements (REQ-1 through REQ-4) appear to be addressed: backend variables are converted to stable storage, a migration module is added, and frontend mutation hooks now include detailed error handling with formatBackendError utility.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Migration module (backend/migration.mo) that migrates userProfiles to persistentUserProfiles",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not mention creating a migration system or renaming userProfiles. This appears to be an implementation detail beyond the stated requirements of adding stable storage declarations.",
